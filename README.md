Helping Farmers to manage their fields in a better and a more effective way
This is an IoT project that will help farmers to monitor their fields from their phones.
The sensors provided in this kit will help the farmers to locate the areas in their fields where water/ insecticides/ pesticides are required. so that the amount of water and these chemicals that is wasted due to traditional irrigation and other methods.
This will also help the fields to be kept safe from intruders and wild animals, this will also lower the amount of hard work that the farmers have to do everyday.

In drought prone areas water can be saved upto 50% if methods like this is used.
Time taken for spraying pesticides and insecticdes can be reduced by a large scale.


This kit includes a nodemcu, a soil moisture sensor, a microphone and some other sensors to monitor the health of the crops.
the included app is very basic and can be used easily by anybody. All the user has to do is install the app, connect to wifi
and place the sensor where the crops are present. There are multiple failsafes in place to ensure the proper information reaches to the user at the earliest. This app Stores the data on Firebase and also sends the data independently to the user's phone for realtime applications.

In future versions we plan to include drone support, through which these areas can be automatically irrigated without the farmers intervention.
